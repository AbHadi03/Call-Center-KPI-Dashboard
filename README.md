Call Center KPI Dashboard
Project Overview
The Call Center KPI Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for a call center. It offers insights into overall performance, individual agent statistics, and customer satisfaction, while enabling dynamic data exploration through the use of slicers.

Data Preparation
The dataset includes various fields related to call center operations, such as call start times, call statuses, customer satisfaction scores, agent IDs, and handle times. Key measures and calculated columns were created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive meaningful KPIs.

Visualizations and Insights
Answered Calls and Resolved Calls (Donut Charts)
Answered Calls: Displays the percentage of calls that were answered versus those that were not. The chart shows that 81.08% of calls were answered, while 18.92% were not.
Resolved Calls: Illustrates the percentage of calls that were resolved. It indicates that 72.92% of calls were resolved, while 27.08% were not.
Number of Calls per Month (Stacked Column Chart)
This visualization shows the number of calls answered and not answered for each month (January, February, and March). It highlights the total calls for each month:
January: 1,455 calls answered, 317 not answered.
February: 1,298 calls answered, 318 not answered.
March: 1,301 calls answered, 311 not answered.
This helps identify trends and fluctuations in call volumes over the three-month period.
Average Speed of Answer (Card Visualization)
This card displays the average speed of answer in seconds, which is 67.52 seconds. It provides a quick metric to understand how quickly calls are being answered on average.
Agent Statistics (Table)
This table lists detailed statistics for individual agents, including:
#of answered calls: Number of calls answered by each agent.
#of resolved calls: Number of calls resolved by each agent.
Average Satisfaction Rate: The average satisfaction score for each agent.
Average Speed of Answer: The average time in seconds it took for each agent to answer a call.
Example statistics:
Becky: Answered 517 calls, resolved 462, average satisfaction rate of 3.37, and an average speed of answer of 65.33 seconds.
Dan: Answered 523 calls, resolved 471, average satisfaction rate of 3.45, and an average speed of answer of 67.28 seconds.
Average Customer Satisfaction (Gauge Chart)
This gauge chart shows the average customer satisfaction score, which is 3.40 out of 5. It provides a quick overview of customer sentiment based on the scores given after calls.
Interactivity with Slicers
The dashboard includes slicers for:

Agent: Allows filtering of data based on specific agents.
Topic: Enables filtering based on the call topic (though specific topics are not listed in the image, the slicer is present).
Date Range: A date slicer allows for selecting a specific time period, with the default range set from January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2021.
These slicers add dynamic interactivity, enabling users to drill down into specific data points and customize the view according to their needs.

Insights and Actions
Performance Monitoring: The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of key metrics, allowing call center managers to monitor overall performance and identify areas needing improvement.
Agent Analysis: Detailed agent statistics help in recognizing high performers and those who may require additional training or support.
Customer Satisfaction: The average satisfaction score offers insights into customer experience, guiding initiatives to enhance service quality.
Operational Efficiency: Metrics like the average speed of answer and monthly call volumes help in understanding operational efficiency and workload distribution.
